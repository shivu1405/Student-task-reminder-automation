# Problem

Students often have to manage multiple academic tasks with different deadlines. Relying on memory or manual notes can lead to missed submissions, poor time management, and unnecessary stress. I noticed this as a common issue among students, including myself, and wanted to build a simple solution to address it.
 
# Solution

I developed a Python-based automation tool that helps students manage tasks and deadlines efficiently. The program allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, automatically categorizes them based on urgency (overdue, due soon, or later), and provides reminder alerts at regular intervals.

The focus of this project was to create a clear, usable, and practical automation, rather than a complex system.

# Key Features

Add, update, and delete academic tasks

Automatically categorize tasks based on deadlines

Generate a task summary (overdue, due soon, later)

Periodic reminder alerts to improve task awareness

Simple and user-friendly command-line interface


# Technologies Used

Python

datetime module

File handling for task storage

# Impact

This automation reduces the effort required to manually track tasks and helps students stay aware of upcoming deadlines. It improves time management, reduces the chances of missing submissions, and demonstrates how simple automation can solve everyday problems.

# Future Improvements

Email or notification-based reminders

Graphical or web-based interface

Cloud-based task storage

# Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned how to identify a real-world problem, design a logical solution, and implement it using Python automation. The project also helped me understand the importance of usability, clarity, and incremental improvement in software development.
